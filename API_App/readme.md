# ASP.NET WEB API
- The REST API Technology for .NET Framework
- The ApiController
	- Base class for WEB API
	- Contains Http-Action Methods
		- HttpGet, HttpPost, HttpPut, and HttpDelete
- Steps for ApiController Execution 
	- Server Accept Request
		- e.g.
			- http://www.myserver.com/api/MyController
	- The Route Table will Evaluate the URL and will  Read the 'Path-Expressoin'
		- '/api/MyController'
	- Thsi will be passed to RouteHandler
		- Check the 'Matching ApiController'  to the MyController and the information will be passed to the HttpHandler
	- HttpHandler will look for 'MyController', if found then the Instance of MyController class 'inside the ControllerContext' will be created
		- Verify the Security (If applied)
			- If the Security Failed the HTTP Response with UnAuthorized (401) will be send
		- Load and Instantiate Action Filters (If Applied)
		- The Dependency will be injected (If the DI is used)
		- The 'Controller' instance will be generated 
	- Action Execution

			- HttpGet -- Get()

			- HttpPut -- Put()
			- HttpDelete -- Delete()
